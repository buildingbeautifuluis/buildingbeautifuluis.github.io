Chapter 10: UI Glossary
=======================

<!-- 878 Words -->

**As I’ve noted in the [overview](https://github.com/fehler/building-beautiful-uis/blob/master/00-Overview.md), this is a work in progress and I’m sharing it here in draft form. It isn’t finished – in fact this glossary isn’t even started – but I hope it provides some value as I finalise all of the chapter content.**

This is the glossary that will accompany the book.

This is an initial scratch file gathering terms I’ll be defining, I’ll be adding draft content shortly. This is just scratch content (and definitely isn't worth reading). I'm adding unedited content to this page as I find it.

## 5 Second Test

This is a gut reaction test designed to capture first impressions. (As I’ve noted above, this isn’t the finished text, it will be richer!)

## A/B Test

An A/B Test is designed to test two variants of a similar design to see which is more effective.

## Accessibility

Here I should stress the importance of ensuring user interfaces are accessible. This might be achieved in a variety of ways (but starts – on the web – with a solid foundation of semantic markup). It’s important to consider the colors you use, ensuring there is enough contrast between text and the background color.

XD-Specific Terms
=================

I think we should separate these from the rest of the entries, but I do think we should include them. Auto Animate, Repeat Grid, etc., are all worth defining.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.

You might like to [follow me](https://www.twitter.com/fehler) on Twitter for updates on this book, that book and other projects I’m working on.
