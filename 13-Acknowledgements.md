**As I’ve noted in the [overview](https://github.com/fehler/building-beautiful-uis/blob/master/00-Overview.md), this is a work in progress and I’m sharing it here in draft form. It isn’t finished, but I hope it provides some value as I finalise all of the chapter content.**



I’d like to thank my wife Cara for her tireless support and for offering an objective opinion whenever the need arose. I appreciate it hugely, though it might not always show. When I ran out of energy (often!), Cara was on hand to help me put together a much-needed task list and without her constant encouragement this book and accompanying course materials would never have been finished.

Ross and Caitlín, my son and daughter, are always on hand to offer a down to earth opinion, for which I’m always thankful, they tell it like it is. As a father they make me immensely proud.

Amanda Gross Tuft, who commissioned this project, has kept me on my toes throughout the process of organising everything. She’s not afraid to challenge my thinking, encouraging me to clarify the narrative when it’s needed and sharpen up my writing. For that I’m eternally grateful.

Dan Gold – one of my second year Interaction Design students – very kindly pitched in and built a website for the book while I was working on it. This allowed me to share it as I finished chapters. Dan’s a very talented student and his support was very much appreciated.

/*

Also:

+ My colleagues at Belfast School of Art: Dr Kyle Boyd, who kindly edited the book; and Paul McCormack, who offered me countless second opinions, drawn from his teaching practice.
+ My studiomates Tim Potter and Gaby Muldoon at Little Thunder, who are always on hand with thoughts and insights.

*/

Finally, I’d like to thank the Adobe XD Slack and Discord community members – in particular Howard Pinsky and Gus Martin at Adobe – who have pitched in with ideas and helped to improve the materials. Thank you to everyone who contributed with their thoughts and encouragement.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
