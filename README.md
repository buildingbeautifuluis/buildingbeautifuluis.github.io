Building Beautiful UIs
======================

**This is initial draft content for my forthcoming ‘course in a book’, ‘Building Beautiful UIs’, which I’m writing for the Adobe XD team. Please don’t share this content, it’s a work in progress and I’m sharing it in draft form.**

‘Building Beautiful UIs’ isn’t just a book, it’s a course in book that’s accompanied by a wealth of digital extras. When the book’s published we’ll be including: 30+ XD files; 5 printable cheat sheets; and a series of templates that you can use freely. The content is drawn from my 25+ years working as a designer and 15+ years working as an educator. In short: It’s all tried and tested.
