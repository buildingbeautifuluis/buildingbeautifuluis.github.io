=========================

<!-- 589 Words -->

**As I’ve noted in the [overview](https://github.com/fehler/building-beautiful-uis/blob/master/00-Overview.md), this is a work in progress and I’m sharing it here in draft form. It isn’t finished, but I hope it provides some value as I finalise all of the chapter content.**

Summary
-------

**In this chapter I’ve interviewed a cross-section of industry professionals who are all working in different aspects of user interface design. I've interviewed three different – and very talented – designers who are working in user interface design in different ways.**



Overview
--------

I’m thinking of focusing the Project X-Rays down to three people (Vic Bell, Howard Pinsky and Val Head) so that we can get the book finished – and published – more quickly.

Everything’s taking a long time to complete and I think we could add a couple more X-Rays once it’s published. The beauty of a digital publication is we can update it. I have others I’ve spoken to who are keen to be included, if there’s time we can build them in.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.

Bonus Content

I think the bonus content for this chapter will be Master-Apprentice exercises where I get permission from each of the people we interview to explore an example of their work.

I’ll then analyse, deconstruct and reconstruct it using XD. I’ve run this past the interviewees and it shouldn’t be a problem.
